# Project Overview

This project was done as part of the final Udacity FrontEnd Nanodegree.

The project 'scenario' is that a dev wrote a piece of the tests for an application
and then decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an
application with an incomplete test suite.

The project goals were to finish writing the necessary tests


## Why this Project?

This project is a starter into the world of TDD (test-driven development).
